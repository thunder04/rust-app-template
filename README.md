# Rust application template

My template for creating a Rust application. It features logging using [`tracing`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing), [`color_eyre`](https://crates.io/crates/color_eyre) for pretty panicking and [`thiserror`](https://crates.io/crates/thiserror) for specialized error handling.
